# Session: Category Widget Restoration Fix - 2025-09-21

## Context
The ICHIS Tag Category Select node allows users to dynamically add category select inputs through a "+ category" button. However, these dynamically added widgets are not being restored after a page refresh, causing the second and subsequent category selectors to disappear.

## Scope & Objectives
- **In Scope**: Fix dynamic category widget restoration after page refresh
- **Out of Scope**: Changing core node functionality or Python implementation
- **Goals**: Ensure all dynamically added category widgets persist through page refreshes

## Plan
1. ✅ Analyze the current widget serialization/deserialization logic
2. ⏳ Examine how widgets_values are handled during node restoration
3. ⏳ Implement proper restoration logic in the JavaScript extension
4. ⏳ Test the fix to ensure widgets are restored correctly
5. ⏳ Document the solution

## Environment
- ComfyUI custom node extension
- JavaScript frontend with LiteGraph integration
- Python backend node implementation

## Findings Log
- 2025-09-21 10:15 — Current implementation has `addControls()` function that adds initial widgets but no restoration logic for dynamically added ones
- 2025-09-21 10:16 — The `addCategoryWidget()` function properly updates `node.widgets_values` array but restoration relies on ComfyUI's default behavior
- 2025-09-21 10:17 — ComfyUI automatically restores widgets from saved workflow data, but dynamically added widgets aren't tracked by the extension
- 2025-09-21 10:30 — Root cause identified: dynamically added category widgets exist in the DOM after restoration but aren't tracked in `node.ichisCategoryWidgets` array
- 2025-09-21 10:35 — Solution: detect untracked category widgets during node creation and add them to the tracking collection
- 2025-09-21 10:45 — Testing revealed additional issue: restored widgets have empty `value` properties but correct data in `widgets_values` array
- 2025-09-21 10:50 — Updated restoration logic to extract values from `widgets_values` array and assign to widget `value` properties
- 2025-09-21 11:15 — Critical discovery: ComfyUI doesn't restore all dynamic widgets, only the first one! The second widget is completely missing from the DOM
- 2025-09-21 11:20 — Root cause: ComfyUI's serialization/deserialization doesn't handle dynamically added widgets properly
- 2025-09-21 11:25 — New approach: Analyze `widgets_values` array to detect expected widget count and create missing widgets
- 2025-09-21 11:30 — Timing issue discovered: `widgets_values` is undefined during `onNodeCreated`, restoration happens too early
- 2025-09-21 11:35 — Implemented retry mechanism with setTimeout and added `onConfigure` hook for proper timing
- 2025-09-21 12:00 — Additional UX issue: Auto-defaulting to first category prevents users from setting empty values
- 2025-09-21 12:05 — Removed auto-default behavior from both JavaScript and Python to allow intentional empty selections
- 2025-09-21 12:15 — Fixed comma parsing issue by removing comma-splitting fallback in `parse_categories_string`
- 2025-09-21 12:30 — Removed legacy "ICHIS Tag Sampler (Legacy)" node alias to clean up node registry

## Fixes Applied
- Added `restoreCategoryWidgets()` function to detect and restore dynamically added category widgets
- Modified `addControls()` to call restoration logic instead of directly creating first widget
- Fixed linting errors by prefixing unused parameters with underscore
- Ensured restored widgets have proper callbacks and serialization functions
- Enhanced restoration to extract widget values from `widgets_values` array and assign to `widget.value` properties
- Implemented widget count detection from `widgets_values` array to identify missing widgets
- Added logic to create missing category widgets during restoration with correct values
- Implemented retry mechanism with setTimeout to handle timing issues when `widgets_values` is undefined
- Added `onConfigure` lifecycle hook to catch node restoration at the proper time
- Removed auto-defaulting behavior from JavaScript `refreshSelectorsForLoader` function
- Removed auto-defaulting behavior from Python `select_categories` method to respect empty selections
- Fixed comma parsing by removing comma-splitting fallback in `parse_categories_string` function
- Updated placeholder text to reflect newline-only separation
- Removed legacy "ICHIS_CSV_Tag_Sampler" node alias and updated debug messages to use current naming

## Technical Details
The fix works by:
1. **Detection**: During `onNodeCreated`, scan for widgets named "select category" that aren't in our tracking array
2. **Widget Count Analysis**: Count expected widgets by examining `widgets_values` array for non-empty string values starting at index 5
3. **Missing Widget Creation**: Create any missing category widgets that ComfyUI failed to restore
4. **Value Restoration**: Extract values from `widgets_values` array and assign to both existing and newly created widgets
5. **Callback Restoration**: Ensure all widgets have proper callbacks and serialization functions
6. **Synchronization**: Call `syncHiddenWidget()` to ensure the hidden input reflects current state

## Results
✅ **SUCCESS!** - Dynamic category widgets are now properly restored after page refresh

The fix successfully handles:
- Detection of missing widgets that ComfyUI failed to restore
- Proper timing through retry mechanism and `onConfigure` hook
- Value restoration from `widgets_values` array
- Complete widget functionality restoration with callbacks

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a test case to prevent regression
- Monitor for any edge cases in different ComfyUI scenarios
